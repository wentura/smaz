**Zodpovednyhub.cz**

static site for a small place in Melnik(CZ). It's showrroom for Zodpovednavuyka.cz and community hub for people around Katerina Hrabikova.

First idea was about dynamic content for calendar of lectures, but due shortfall in the budget I build just this. I don'tlike it, but you know, don't sell yourself cheap. And play fair.

First time I get review from a client like a video. Nice. But, how to negotiate upwork, 'cause those points are NOT "fixes". That's new challenge.

1st and the last roudn of fixes ;)
